# Joinhowdy_projects
In this respository, I will update the jupyter notebook and other files which were part of the ongoing Joinhowdy Python session with [Shivkumar Iyer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iyershivkumar/).

The current project is available on the jupyter notebook: https://github.com/krishnans14/Joinhowdy_projects/blob/main/M5_Competition_EDA.ipynb and concerns that M5 Kaggle project (https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy)
